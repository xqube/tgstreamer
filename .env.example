# - VPS with nginx: SET HOST to your public domain!

# Only set these if you need to override:
# HOST=http://localhost:8080
# PORT=8080

# ===== STREAM LIMITS =====
# VLC needs 3 connections per file: main + tail metadata + seek overlap
#
# Formula:
#   MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS = 3 (per file, fixed for VLC)
#   MAX_TOTAL_STREAMS = users × 4
#
# Examples:
#   1 user  → MAX_TOTAL_STREAMS=4
#   2 users → MAX_TOTAL_STREAMS=8
#   3 users → MAX_TOTAL_STREAMS=12
#
# Memory per stream: ~10-20MB with downloadAsIterable
# Baseline memory: ~100MB (Node.js + mtcute client)
#
# For Render 512MB: MAX_TOTAL_STREAMS=4 (1 user max)

# Per-file limit (VLC needs 3: main + tail + seek overlap)
MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS=3

# Global limit
MAX_TOTAL_STREAMS=4

# Max concurrent users (for reference)
MAX_USERS=1

# Max file entries to cache (default: 50)
# Each entry is just metadata (~100 bytes), not file content
# MAX_FILE_ENTRIES=50
